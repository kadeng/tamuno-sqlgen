# Tamuno SQL Generator

Converts a DSL for SQL Templates into type safe java classes.  Type safe interface to SQL without hassles, and with the full power of all SQL constructs.

Contains Maven and Ant plugins to integrate this into a Java build cycle.

More description might follow later. This code has been part of the larger Tamuno web development framework I wrote once. It's very useful on it's own, so I publish it standalone.
